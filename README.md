# android_two_buttons

Create a two player horizontal clicker. On the left side should be a label with Player 1, a counter label, and a button. On the right side should be a label with Player 2, a counter label, and a button.

Extra Work:
On the very bottom of the screen create a clear button to make all counters go back to zero.
